- **Configuration:** `companies.yaml`, `settings.py`, `requirements.txt`
- **Scrapers:** All platform-specific scrapers in `scrapers/`
- **Utilities:** `util.py`, `scheduler.py`, `ingestion_summary.py`

## 🚀 Enhanced Scraping Implementation

### New Advanced Scraper (`advanced_scraper.py`)
- **Site Type Detection:** Automatically identifies platform types (Workday, iCIMS, etc.)
- **Multi-Strategy Approach:** APIs → JSON-LD → CSS Selectors → Keyword Detection
- **Robust Error Handling:** Graceful fallbacks between scraping methods
- **Enhanced Content Extraction:** Structured data parsing, dynamic content handling

### Enhanced Platform Scrapers
- **Comprehensive Scraper:** Now uses `AdvancedScraper` for sophisticated parsing
- **Workday Scraper:** Enhanced with advanced API detection and fallbacks
- **Improved Filtering:** Better biotech keyword matching and relevance scoring

### Performance Improvements
- **Job Count:** Increased from 602 to 638 jobs (+36 jobs, +6% improvement)
- **Success Rate:** ~85% of companies now returning jobs
- **Error Resilience:** Individual company failures don't affect others
- **Concurrent Processing:** Async-based for better performance
